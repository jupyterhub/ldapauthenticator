# ldapauthenticator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jupyterhub/ldapauthenticator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jupyterhub/ldapauthenticator)

Simple LDAP Authenticator Plugin for JupyterHub

## Installation ##

You can install it from pip with:

```
pip install jupyterhub-ldapauthenticator
```
...or using conda with:
```
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterhub-ldapauthenticator
```


## Logging people out ##

If you make any changes to JupyterHub's authentication setup that changes
which group of users is allowed to login (such as changing `allowed_groups`
or even just turning on LDAPAuthenticator), you **must** change the
jupyterhub cookie secret, or users who were previously logged in and did
not log out would continue to be able to log in!

You can do this by deleting the `jupyterhub_cookie_secret` file. Note
that this will log out *all* users who are currently logged in.


## Usage ##

You can enable this authenticator with the following lines in your
`jupyter_config.py`:

```python
c.JupyterHub.authenticator_class = 'ldapauthenticator.LDAPAuthenticator'
```

### Required configuration ###

At minimum, the following two configuration options must be set before
the LDAP Authenticator can be used:


#### `LDAPAuthenticator.server_address` ####

Address of the LDAP Server to contact. Just use a bare hostname or IP,
without a port name or protocol prefix.


#### `LDAPAuthenticator.bind_dn_template` ####

Template used to generate the full dn for a user from the human readable
username. This must be set to either empty `[]` or to a list of templates the
users belong to. For example, if some of the users in your LDAP database have DN
of the form `uid=Yuvipanda,ou=people,dc=wikimedia,dc=org` and some other users
have DN like `uid=Mike,ou=developers,dc=wikimedia,dc=org` where Yuvipanda and
Mike are the usernames, you would set this config item to be:

```python
c.LDAPAuthenticator.bind_dn_template = [
    "uid={username},ou=people,dc=wikimedia,dc=org",
    "uid={username},ou=developers,dc=wikimedia,dc=org",
]
```

Don't forget the preceeding `c.` for setting configuration parameters! JupyterHub
uses [traitlets](https://traitlets.readthedocs.io) for configuration, and the
`c` represents the [config object](https://traitlets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config.html).

The `{username}` is expanded into the username the user provides.


### Optional configuration ###

#### `LDAPAuthenticator.allowed_groups` ####

LDAP groups whose members are allowed to log in. This must be
set to either empty `[]` (the default, to disable) or to a list of
full DNs that have a `member` attribute that includes the current
user attempting to log in.

As an example, to restrict access only to people in groups
`researcher` or `operations`,

```python
c.LDAPAuthenticator.allowed_groups = [
    "cn=researcher,ou=groups,dc=wikimedia,dc=org",
    "cn=operations,ou=groups,dc=wikimedia,dc=org",
]
```

#### `LDAPAuthenticator.valid_username_regex` ####

All usernames will be checked against this before being sent
to LDAP. This acts as both an easy way to filter out invalid
usernames as well as protection against LDAP injection attacks.

By default it looks for the regex `^[a-z][.a-z0-9_-]*$` which
is what most shell username validators do.

#### `LDAPAuthenticator.use_ssl` ####

Boolean to specify whether to use SSL encryption when contacting
the LDAP server. If it is left to `False` (the default)
`LDAPAuthenticator` will try to upgrade connection with StartTLS.
Set this to be `True` to start SSL connection.

#### `LDAPAuthenticator.server_port` ####

Port to use to contact the LDAP server. Defaults to 389 if no SSL
is being used, and 636 is SSL is being used.

#### `LDAPAuthenticator.lookup_dn` ####

Whether to try a reverse lookup to obtain the user's DN.  Some LDAP servers,
such as Active Directory, don't always bind with the true DN, so this allows
us to discover it based on the username.

```python
c.LDAPAuthenticator.lookup_dn = True
```

#### `LDAPAuthenticator.user_search_base` ####

Only used with `lookup_dn=True`.  Defines the search base for looking up users
in the directory.

```python
c.LDAPAuthenticator.user_search_base = 'ou=People,dc=example,dc=com'
```

#### `LDAPAuthenticator.user_attribute` ####

Only used with `lookup_dn=True`.  Defines the attribute that stores a user's
username in your directory.

```python
# Active Directory
c.LDAPAuthenticator.user_attribute = 'sAMAccountName'

# OpenLDAP
c.LDAPAuthenticator.user_attribute = 'uid'
```

#### `LDAPAuthenticator.lookup_dn_search_filter` ####

How to query LDAP for user name lookup, if `lookup_dn` is set to True.
Default value `'({login_attr}={login})'` should be good enough for most use cases.


#### `LDAPAuthenticator.lookup_dn_search_user`, `LDAPAuthenticator.lookup_dn_search_password` ####

Technical account for user lookup, if `lookup_dn` is set to True.
If both lookup_dn_search_user and lookup_dn_search_password are None, then anonymous LDAP query will be done.


#### `LDAPAuthenticator.lookup_dn_user_dn_attribute` ####

Attribute containing user's name needed for  building DN string, if `lookup_dn` is set to True.
See `user_search_base` for info on how this attribute is used.
For most LDAP servers, this is username.  For Active Directory, it is cn.

#### `LDAPAuthenticator.escape_userdn` ####

If set to True, escape special chars in userdn when authenticating in LDAP.
On some LDAP servers, when userdn contains chars like '(', ')', '\' authentication may fail when those chars
are not escaped.

#### `LDAPAuthenticator.auth_state_attributes` ####

An optional list of attributes to be fetched for a user after login.
If found these will be returned as `auth_state`.

#### `LDAPAuthenticator.use_lookup_dn_username` ####

If set to True (the default) the username used to build the DN string is returned as the username when `lookup_dn` is True.

When authenticating on a Linux machine against an AD server this might return something different from the supplied UNIX username. In this case setting this option to False might be a solution.

## Compatibility ##

This has been tested against an OpenLDAP server, with the client
running Python 3.4. Verifications of this code working well with
other LDAP setups are welcome, as are bug reports and patches to make
it work with other LDAP setups!


## Active Directory integration ##

Please use following options for AD integration. This is useful especially in two cases:
* LDAP Search requires valid user account in order to query user database
* DN does not contain login but some other field, like CN (actual login is present in sAMAccountName, and we need to lookup CN)

```python
c.LDAPAuthenticator.lookup_dn = True
c.LDAPAuthenticator.lookup_dn_search_filter = '({login_attr}={login})'
c.LDAPAuthenticator.lookup_dn_search_user = 'ldap_search_user_technical_account'
c.LDAPAuthenticator.lookup_dn_search_password = 'secret'
c.LDAPAuthenticator.user_search_base = 'ou=people,dc=wikimedia,dc=org'
c.LDAPAuthenticator.user_attribute = 'sAMAccountName'
c.LDAPAuthenticator.lookup_dn_user_dn_attribute = 'cn'
c.LDAPAuthenticator.escape_userdn = False
```

In setup above, first LDAP will be searched (with account ldap_search_user_technical_account) for users that have sAMAccountName=login
Then DN will be constructed using found CN value.


## Configuration note on local user creation

Currently, local user creation by the LDAPAuthenticator is unsupported as
this is insecure since there's no cleanup method for these created users. As a
result, users who are disabled in LDAP will have access to this for far longer.

Alternatively, there's good support in Linux for integrating LDAP into the
system user setup directly, and users can just use PAM (which is supported in
not just JupyterHub, but ssh and a lot of other tools) to log in. You can see
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/archived/LDAP-Implementation-HOWTO/pamnss.html and
lots of other documentation on the web on how to set up LDAP to provide user
accounts for your system. Those methods are very widely used, much more secure
and more widely documented. We recommend you use them rather than have
JupyterHub create local accounts using the LDAPAuthenticator.

Issue [#19](https://github.com/jupyterhub/ldapauthenticator/issues/19) provides
additional discussion on local user creation.
